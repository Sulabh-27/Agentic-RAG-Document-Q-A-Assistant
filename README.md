# Agentic-RAG-Document-Q-A-Assistant

This project streamlines document processing by supporting multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV), splitting and storing them in a FAISS vector database with feedback on chunk counts. A custom Agentic RAG system, powered by LangChain agents, enables efficient document retrieval, structured reasoning, and well-sourced responses.

The chat interface maintains context, displays messages in a conversational format, and provides real-time feedback. Users can select from multiple language models (e.g., llama3-70b-8192, mixtral-8x7b-32768, gemma2-9b-it) and configure parameters like temperature, chunk size, and reasoning depth. The system also includes a reasoning display, error handling, and query history with a reuse button for past queries.

Advanced features include enhanced prompting, API key management, and an agent refresh function. A clear document button simplifies document management. The RAG tool-based architecture ensures efficient retrieval, guided by a detailed system message and conversation buffer memory for maintaining context, delivering an optimized and user-friendly experience.
